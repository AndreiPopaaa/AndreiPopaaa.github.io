      <strong>San Francisco!</strong>
      In 2019 for 4 mounths i was working in San Francisco.The oportunity for working in another country like SUA was
      really nice for my self developmentSan Francisco, officially the City and County of San Francisco and colloquially
      known as The City, SF, or Frisco and San Fran[20][21] is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of
      Northern California. San Francisco is the 16th most populous city in the United States, and the fourth most
      populous in California, with 881,549 residents as of 2019.[15] It covers an area of about 46.89 square miles
      (121.4 km2),[22] mostly at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, making it
      the second most densely populated large U.S. city, and the fifth most densely populated U.S. county, behind only
      four of the five New York City boroughs. San Francisco is the 12th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the
      United States by population, with 4.7 million people, and the fourth-largest by economic output, with GDP of $549
      billion in 2018.[23] With San Jose, it forms the fifth most populous combined statistical area in the United
      States, the San Jose–San Francisco–Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area (9.67 million residents in 2018).

      <strong>Bike Reparing!</strong>
      I can repair bike.This ability i learned in San Francisco at the Blazzing Saddles.If you have breaks,wheels,flat
      tires,
      speed gear to change i can help you.My experience is a good example cause i can repair your bike.I'm looking
      forward to see
      your bike.
      f course, you always have the option of taking matters into your own hands and trying to sew the tear yourself. If
      you’re not looking for perfection, you can use double-sided heat-fusion tape to cover a small hole, or sew it shut
      using a star-patterned stich with a needle. Here’s a guide to felting small holes in wool jerseys.

      For larger holes, iron-on patches (on low, low heat) might get you by, but unless you have a lot of sewing
      experience, the fix will be noticeable—and could even chafe from the inside.
